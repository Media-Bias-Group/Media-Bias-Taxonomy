In this repo, we detail all workflows accompanying our Media Bias Taxonomy. Also, we publish an easily usable literature crawler to execute literature reviews.

# Introduction
This repository contains all resources from the paper "The Media Bias Taxonomy: A Systematic Literature Review on the Forms and Automated Detection of Media Bias." Our literature review summarizes the research on computational methods to detect media bias by systematically reviewing 3140 research papers published between 2019 and 2022. The link to the paper will be added in case of journal acceptance.

# 1. Crawler
## Get started with our crawler
___
To facilitate research of media bias we share....f code:
```python 
from datasets import load_dataset

### Note
Due to the fact that not all MBIB tasks are available for public distribution, we share our benchmark dataset in two versions


# 2. The tables
As mentioned in the paper, we publish the accompanying tables. They can be found [here on Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/deposit/7707761)

# 3. Citation
Please cite us as:
```python
